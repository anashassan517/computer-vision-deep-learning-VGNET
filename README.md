1- There are two datasets that contain Scolograms obtained after applying Wavelet transform on the data.<br />
2- Applied Pre-trained Deep Learning models.<br />
3- Performed classification score.<br />
4- Performed Confusion matrix.<br />
5- You can use data augmentation and other pre-processing techniques to improve the classification score.<br />
